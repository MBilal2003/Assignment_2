                        <h3>1) BABAR AZAM</h3>
                        <p id="babar_azam_p1">My favorite personality is <b>Babar Azam</b>, who is a Pakistani
                            international cricketer and captain of the Pakistan national cricket team in all formats.
                            Regarded as one of the finest batters in contemporary world cricket, he is the only
                            cricketer in the world to be in the <b>top five rankings across all formats</b>. He is
                            ranked as the number one batter in ODIs, 5th in Tests and 4th in T20Is.</p>

                        <p id="babar_azam_p2">A right-handed top-order batter, he plays for and <b>captains Peshawar
                                Zalmi in the PSL</b> and Central Punjab in domestic cricket of Pakistan. With 42 wins,
                            he is the <b>joint most successful T20I captain</b> of all time. Babar Azam's maiden T20
                            century of 122 which he scored against South Africa is the highest current individual score
                            by a Pakistani in the format. Azam was a member of the Pakistan team that won the 2017 ICC
                            Champions Trophy.</p>

                        <h3>2) IMRAN KHAN</h3>
                        <p id="imran_khan_p1">Another one of my favorite personalities is <b>Imran Khan</b>, who is a
                            Pakistani politician and former cricket captain who served as the <b>22nd Prime Minister of
                                Pakistan</b> from August 2018 until April 2022. He is the founder and chairman of the
                            political party Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf (PTI).</p>

                        <p id="imran_khan_p2">Founding the PTI in 1996, Khan won a seat in the National Assembly in the

                            boycotted the 2008 general election and became the second-largest party by popular vote in
                            the 2013 general election.In the 2018 general election, running on a populist platform, PTI
                            became the <b>largest party in the National Assembly</b>, and formed a coalition government
                            with independents with Khan as Prime Minister.</p>

                        <h3>3) FEROZE KHAN</h3>
                        <p id="feroze_khan_p1">My third favorite personality is <b>Feroze Khan</b>, who is a Pakistani
                            actor, model and video jockey, who works in Urdu television. He made his acting debut with
